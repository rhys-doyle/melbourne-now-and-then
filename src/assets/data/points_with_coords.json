From 1916 to the 1960s, most of the coins produced in Australia were created on this site.

    "Description": "Queens Wharf was the first wharf on the Yarra River, built in the early 1840s. It was located near Customs House and the Melbourne Fish Market, both in Flinders Street. The area was surrounded by swamps and mud and when the Yarra River flooded, water and mud would cover the wharf. The primitive conditions meant that boats would be tied to trees.  There were wharves on the north and south sides of the river, but by the 1950s the northern side was substantially filled in so the land could be reclaimed.",

The Capitol theatreÃ¯Â¿Â½s highlight is the art deco plaster ceiling, which contains hidden lights. Originally it operated as MelbourneÃ¯Â¿Â½s first picture palace. Despite demolition of the ground floor and stalls, the upper foyers and the front facade remain unharmed. In 1999, it was purchased by Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, but it still operates as a public film and live performance venue.",

In the ballroom was the Plaza Theatre, with seating for more than 1000 people. A fire in 1945 resulted in much of the interior being rebuilt, but to the original design. When its owner Hoyts sold it off in 1970, it seemed destined for demolition and was closed for over twenty years. Council intervention restored the building and it re-opened in 1996. Today it is a popular live theatre, music and comedy venue.",

However William Wardell, the Inspector-General of Public Works, was instructed to reduce costs, so architect John James Clark modified the plans to a more restrained two storeys. From 1916 to the 1960s, most of the coins produced in Australia were created on this site. After decimal currency was introduced in the late 1960s, and the Commonwealth Mint in Canberra was opened, there was no longer a need for a mint in Melbourne. The building is now home to the Hellenic Museum.",

With four storeys decorated with fountains, 'opus sectile' (mosaic) floors and mirrored walls, and topped with a dome, the building was famously opulent. The hotel had 80 bedrooms upstairs, and a popular bar and cafÃ¯Â¿Â½ at street level. The building was demolished in 1961 to make way for WaltonÃ¯Â¿Â½s department store. The space later housed a cinema, before being transformed into the Mid-City Centre, where a cinema still operates today.",

During its operation it housed many hardened criminals, as well as petty offenders, the mentally ill and the homeless. It was the site of over 130 hangings, including bushranger Ned Kelly in 1880. The last hanging occurred in 1924. The doors were finally closed in 1929 but did reopen briefly during the Second World War, when Australian soldiers who were absent without leave (AWOL) were imprisoned. Today it is a tourist attraction and is managed by the National Trust of Australia.",

    "Description": "Formerly Spencer Street Station, Southern Cross Station is MelbourneÃ¯Â¿Â½s central rail and bus terminal, servicing regional Victoria and interstate. It also connects with MelbourneÃ¯Â¿Â½s City Loop. When it opened in 1858, Spencer Street consisted of just one platform but by 1928 fourteen platforms were operating. Further works were carried out in the 1960s following the introduction of the standard gauge spacing for rails. The next redevelopment spanned 2002-2006 and included the addition of retail outlets. Spencer Street Station was then renamed Southern Cross Station.  In 2007 the station was judged the most outstanding building outside the European Union by the Royal Institute of British Architects' and the undulating roof is of particular interest.",
